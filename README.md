## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This is a Python project I worked on during Sixth Form, I made this game for my coursework, to develop my skills with Python and PyGame. The result is this space shooter game similar to the likes of Galaga.

What I learned from this project:

* Making use of PyGame
* Developing my skills with Python
* Graphics design elements
* Working with full stack, from design and front end to back end
* Using API's 
* Learning Object Oriented programming techniques


## Built With

Here are the main frameworks I used

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
* [Visual Studio IDE ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
